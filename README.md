A simple gardening game.

Have the blueprint in game_blueprint.rb

Commands you can use when running it:
  
  tree = Garden.new 
  
  tree.plant 'apple'      
  :   You just planted an apple tree. By watering it, you will get fruits to collect. 
      You now have in total 1 trees.
  
  tree.trees              
  :   You have 3 trees.
  
  tree.water              
  :   You just watered your trees and maybe can collect some fruits!
  
  tree.fruits             
  :   You have 96 fruits.
  
  tree.collect            
  :   You can collect 96 fruits.
  


Tried to do a working gardening game from the blueprint, but can't sort it out yet the repeatedness.
